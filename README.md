PROCESS: Photos are from exercise: finetuning 2. 
Text is from generated text from NLP exercise using an ethics and philosophy book found on Project Gutenberg to train the system. I edited some of the text to make it a more coherent thought. 
Photos and background sound were edited in Adobe Premiere.

RESULT AND REFLECTION: The result is a video moving through the question of what human nature plans for the future and when will human nature end. This question is very philosophical to me and ties itself
with the idea of anthropocene as a force that will end itself because of its unintentional destruction. I think this fits in with the process of thought I've had while generated the other photos which ask similar
questions of how humananity tries to fit in with nature and mimics nature due to the way we've overtaken much of the natural world. All of these thought are very philsophical and, to me, lonely. That is why I added
the sounds of mourning doves which sound melancholy and remind me a lot of the time I've spend in nature. The white noise in the background goes quieter after the question of ending. We don't know what will happen after
the end of human nature. And we don't know what future is, especially with the way we are heading as we pollute the earth. 
The moving of photos is also intentional as I chose generated images and layered them to create a sense of narrative. The first image I interpret as light and an explosion of the universe. The second I layered with an image that
looked like skulls or bones to me. The last generated image reminds me of dust or sand, which could represent the end of anthropocene in this narrative. But, with how abstract these iamges are, they are all open to the 
viewers interpretation.

FINAL THOUGHTS: My aim with this video is to provoke philsophical or reflective thought on humans in relation to nature.
